Vibe-coding this thing with Gemini & Grok, one feature at a time.

To Do:
- Ranks, in order to filter Edges and stuff
- Localization, set into different files (en_data.js, ru_data.js)
- Local storage, to save characters in a browser
- Export/Import of the characters

Considering:
- Import of Races, Skills, Edges, Hindrances and Gear for custom worlds
- Classes, as templates with pre-set parameters
- Magic???
